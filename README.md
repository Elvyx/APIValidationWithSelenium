# APIValidationWithSelenium: Automating API testing using Selenium WebDriver for a scenario involving a web service response and validating it in a web application UI can be achieved by following these steps:

**Setup:**
Install Selenium WebDriver and the appropriate browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver).
Create a new Java project and add necessary dependencies (Selenium and any other required libraries).
Set up your project structure and create necessary classes for test automation.

**API Testing:**
Use a library like Apache HttpClient or OkHttp to make API requests and retrieve responses.
Parse the API response to extract the relevant data that you want to validate in the web application.


**Selenium WebDriver Automation:**
Open a browser using Selenium WebDriver and navigate to the web application URL.
Use Selenium WebDriver commands to interact with the UI elements, such as filling out forms, clicking buttons, etc.


**Validation:**
Extract the relevant data from the web application UI using Selenium WebDriver commands.
Compare the API response data and the web application data for validation.

The Class name-APIVAlidationWithSelenium2 contains the code for API Automation creation (POST-request) as well as Automating same request on the web browser. The API URL used is https://demoqa.com/Account/v1/user and the request type is a post request which returned a success message as 201 Created and the Web application Url is https://demoqa.com/register. 

A show stopper was encounter during the execution of the scripts, as the Captcha could not automated by selenium. This prevented the scripts from running properly.
Selenium do not automate Captcha and this is a showstopper to automating user registration process.
